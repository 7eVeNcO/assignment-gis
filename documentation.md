## Backend
Backend application is written in `Node.JS` with usage of `Express` micro-framework. All dependencies are built with NPM package manager.

### Data
We used data of Bratislava from Open Street Maps. We used `osm2pgsql` to convert them to Postgres. 
We also used external data source Zomato.com. Zomato.com provides simple API to search for their restaurants. We made a simple `python` application to make 400 API Calls to `https://developers.zomato.com/api/v2.1/search`. API returns 20 nearest points to requested lat and long parameters. So we started at lat/long '48.198935/16.976767' and ended at '48.100553/17.200356'. We saved our spots from responses to .json files.

Then we created parser to parse informations from parsed fiels to Postgres. Advantage of this method was, that Zomato provides additional informations about restaurants:
- user rating
- ratings count
- restaurant cuisines

### Database optimalisations
**Query: Get nearest restaurats:**
Query cost: 13432.38

We created separated table for eating spots: spots_polygons.

`CREATE TABLE spots_polygons
  AS (
	  SELECT osm_id, way, name, amenity FROM planet_osm_polygon
	  WHERE (amenity = 'restaurant' OR amenity = 'bar' OR amenity = 'cafe' OR amenity = 'fast_food') and name!=''
  );`
  
Optimalized Query cost: 525.96

We created separated table for parking spots: 

`CREATE TABLE parkings_polygons
AS (SELECT osm_id,name,way FROM planet_osm_polygon
WHERE amenity like 'parking');`

Optimalized Query cost: 624.69..6236.32

**Query: Eating spots in area:**
Query cost: 0.29..458.84

We created separated table for administrative_polygons:

`CREATE TABLE administrative_polygons
AS (SELECT name, way, admin_level FROM planet_osm_polygon 
WHERE boundary like 'administrative');`

We created index on name of area.

`CREATE INDEX ON administrative_polygons(name)`

Optimalized Query cost:
cost=0.14..458.69

**Get aggregated rating in areas:**
Query time: 5s

We created new column in administrative_polygons, where we inserted transfomed data.

`UPDATE administrative_polygons
SET way4326 = ST_Transform(way,4326)`

New Query time: 1s
