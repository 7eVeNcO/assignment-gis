### Data
We used data of Bratislava from Open Street Maps. We used `osm2pgsql` to convert them to Postgres. 
We also used external data source Zomato.com. Zomato.com provides simple API to search for their restaurants. We made a simple `python` application to make 400 API Calls to `https://developers.zomato.com/api/v2.1/search`. API returns 20 nearest points to requested lat and long parameters. So we started at lat/long '48.198935/16.976767' and ended at '48.100553/17.200356'. We saved our spots from responses to .json files.

Then we created parser to parse informations from parsed fiels to Postgres. Advantage of this method was, that Zomato provides additional informations about restaurants:
- user rating
- ratings count
- restaurant cuisines

- [Zomato] (https://www.zomato.com/sk/bratislava)
